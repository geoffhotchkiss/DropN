DropN is a clone of the iPhone Drop7 game written in Common Lisp.

To run the game, load the dropn.lisp file in your favorite Common Lisp 
implementation and run (play-game). I have tested this with SBCL and CLisp. 
There is currently a problem with adding your pieces to the board and no
game logic is implemented yet.
